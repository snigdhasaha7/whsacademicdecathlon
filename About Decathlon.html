<button type="button" class="collapsible" style="border-bottom: 2px solid black;"><h1 style="text-align: center; font-family:'Dancing Script', cursive;"> What is Academic Decathlon? </h1></button>
<div class="content">
<p style="text-align:center; font-family: 'Catamaran',sans-serif;"> Academic Decathlon is a 10-event competition that comprises a series of seven academic tests, an essay, a speech and an interview, as well as a team-based Super Quiz event. The seven tests are in the following subject areas: Art, Economics, Language/Literature, Mathematics, Music, Science, and Social Science. The competition takes place in four rounds. Round 1 is an official scrimmage that takes place in November. Rankings in this round are not official but are a good indicator of how schools stand against others. Round 2 is the official Regionals or County round. Excelling at this round leads to Round 3, or the State round. In California, winners of all counties make it to Round 3, which is held in late March in Sacramento. After that, other schools are invited to this Round based on their rankings against other state schools. Winners at Round 3 represent their state at Round 4, or Nationals, which is the final round of competition. California has been winning Round 4 since 2003 and thus has the most competitive Round 3. Woodbridge has been making it to state for the last 9 years and has represented Orange County as the county champion for the last 4 years. We have never made it to Round 4 but it is a permanent goal that we come a little closer to every year! </p>
<p style="text-align:center; font-family: 'Catamaran',sans-serif;">To prepare for the seven academic tests, Decathletes receive a binder with all the material they must cover, organized in resource guides. Woodbridge, like all other participating schools across the world, receives this material from the United States Academic Decathlon. This organization prepares the material based on the selected theme. For instance, the theme for the upcoming season is The Cold War. The 2019-20 theme was In Sickness and In Health: An Exploration of Illness and Wellness. The 2018-19 theme was America in the 1960s. Some years, the theme is a specific geographic location, such as in 2017-18, when the theme was Africa.</p>
<p style="text-align:center; font-family: 'Catamaran',sans-serif;">There are some portions of the guides that repeat. The math topic, of course, is not dependent on the theme and rotates every three years. As such, the math topic for 2020-21 is “General Math and an Introduction to Differential Calculus”. The first section of art covers art history and art fundamentals, which stays the same every year. The first three sections of economics stay constant, focusing on general economic terms and introductions to microeconomics and macroeconomics. The fourth section focuses on the theme. Most years, the first section of music remains the same as well, unless there is a focus on a specific location. This section covers music theory, from classification of instruments all the way up to different forms in music.</p>
<p style="text-align:center; font-family: 'Catamaran',sans-serif;">If you are familiar with any of the topics mentioned above, or with the Cold War, you already have a good foundation for the year. If not, not to worry! Most do not, but Decathlon is a highly collaborative environment where every member works not only towards their own success, but also for that of their peers. Through our meetings and group study sessions, you will learn everything there is to know in the guide - perhaps well enough to show off your knowledge to non-Decathletes!</p>
<p style="text-align:center; font-family: 'Catamaran',sans-serif;">If at this point, you are still interested in being a part of our program, please continue reading.</p></div><br>

<button type="button" class="collapsible" style="border-bottom: 2px solid black;"><h1 style="text-align: center; font-family:'Dancing Script', cursive;"> Who can be a Decathlete? </h1></button>
<div class="content">
<p style="text-align:center; font-family: 'Catamaran',sans-serif;"> Due to the prestige of Academic Decathlon, there is a common misconception that the program is simply geared towards students who have the highest grades. While our team is always looking for students with strong academic backgrounds, arguably the most important members of the team are those with lower GPAs.</p>
<p style="text-align:center; font-family: 'Catamaran',sans-serif;"> Each Decathlon team must have a minimum of six students (maximum of nine going to the state competition) split evenly among three GPA categories (all unweighted): Honors (3.8-4.0), Scholastic (3.2-3.79), and Varsity (3.19 and below) (We casually refer to the categories as the A’s, B’s, and C’s respectively). Decathletes only compete among other students in their GPA category, but winning schools are determined by the sum of the overall scores. Thus, B and C students do not feel the pressure of having to compete with A students, but they also have the potential to try their hardest to help achieve a team effort. Every year, the question of what school wins the county competition comes down to who has the best B’s and C’s, not who has the students with the highest grades!</p>
<p style="text-align:center; font-family: 'Catamaran',sans-serif;">One of the main goals of Academic Decathlon is to build strong individuals through team competition. That is an opportunity which USAD does not limit to just those with the highest GPAs.</p></div><br>

<button type="button" class="collapsible" style="border-bottom: 2px solid black;"><h1 style="text-align: center; font-family:'Dancing Script', cursive;"> What is the expected time commitment from all Decathletes? </h1></button>
<div class="content">
<p style="text-align:center; font-family: 'Catamaran',sans-serif;">The most straightforward answer is that Decathlon requires a very high level of commitment in order for Woodbridge to maintain its streak as the Orange County champions. Please, if you feel like you have to sacrifice what you want to do the most in your high school career for Decathlon, pursue your dreams instead!</p>
<p style="text-align:center; font-family: 'Catamaran',sans-serif;">To be more specific, our wonderful coach, Mr. Nakaue, has divided up the competition season (June to March) into various phases which become more intensive as the county competition, which takes place in late January and early February, draws closer. During the summer, we meet three times a week, and we extend this schedule into the Fall Semester. However, as the year goes on, we begin to meet more often, including on weekends. Our after school meetings are generally two hours long, but those on school holidays or vacations tend to run longer. The team meets almost every day during Winter Break and in the weeks leading up to Round 2, which takes place in late January. Overall, you should expect to spend about 380 hours in meetings and additional time studying at home before the state competition.</p>
<p style="text-align:center; font-family: 'Catamaran',sans-serif;">We understand the fact that you will have vacations, sick days, school, and other commitments in your life. It is not expected that you come to every single meeting, but please try to keep around an 80% attendance level.  Attendance definitely has a strong correlation with your performance at competition, and being present for meetings is one of the best ways to make a good impression about your commitment to the team (keep in mind that you will be competing for a spot on the team throughout the year).</p></div><br>

<button type="button" class="collapsible" style="border-bottom: 2px solid black;"><h1 style="text-align: center; font-family:'Dancing Script', cursive;"> Do Decathletes have a social life? </h1></button>
<div class="content">
<p style="text-align:center; font-family: 'Catamaran',sans-serif;">Given the intensive outline of the team's schedule above, it may surprise you that Decathlon does not impede but rather strengthens the social lives of our team members! The cooperative nature of studying and preparing for competition instills a sense of camaraderie that is rare in other academic competitions of this rigor. Though Decathletes participate in almost all of the events on an individual basis, a strong bond between teammates has always been necessary to be able to succeed. Even if you know no one on the team at your first meeting, by the end of competition season, you will have made a set of strong friends simply by attending meetings and competing with them. Trust us, most of the members joined feeling scared of what they might be giving up on their end, but finished the program with a new family. The idea that Decathletes are closed-in bookworms simply does not align with the program’s vision for what teamwork looks like, nor is it true.</p>
<p style="text-align:center; font-family: 'Catamaran',sans-serif;">In addition, Woodbridge’s team encourages Decathletes to get together outside of mandatory meetings for social events such as dinners or meetups throughout the year. Our teammates are well-connected with each other on social media platforms and chat rooms (even with alumni), so don’t be afraid to reach out! Understanding your teammates on a more personal level will help you identify their strengths and weaknesses as well as genuinely enjoy the experience that Academic Decathlon brings on a deeper level.</p>
<p style="text-align:center; font-family: 'Catamaran',sans-serif;">However, that does not mean that your social life outside of Decathlon will disappear either despite the massive time commitment. If you can successfully manage your time, you should have plenty of time to go out and do the things you love with the people that matter the most. We recommend that your friends do understand the level of commitment needed for Decathlon properly so that you do not feel excessive pressure to split your time between them. Your experience will be much smoother if you keep a steady balance between preparing for competition and socializing rather than devoting large, separate swaths of time to each.</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible" style="border-bottom: 2px solid black;"><h1 style="text-align: center; font-family:'Dancing Script', cursive;"> What are the benefits of doing Academic Decathlon? </h1></button>
<div class="content">
<p style="text-align:center; font-family: 'Catamaran',sans-serif;">Dr. Robert Peterson established the Academic Decathlon program in 1968 with the purpose of building strong, confident leaders prepared for the challenges and opportunities of the world during and after high school. As such, most Decathletes will report that through their participation, what has stood out the most is the growth of their character, not the awards or accolades that line the surface.</p>
<p style="text-align:center; font-family: 'Catamaran',sans-serif;">The ten-subject format ensures that most Decathletes will find areas in which they have natural talent and challenges. As a member of Woodbridge’s team, you will learn to communicate your ideas and strategies with your teammates to try to maximize success across social boundaries like GPA or grade level which are all too prevalent in high school. The fact that your team’s performance depends on your own commitment to contribute gives every Decathlete leadership skills irrespective of experience or seniority. Our coach and all of your teammates will value your input, and you will get the chance to have your voice heard. There are few experiences like Decathlon which allow you to work on yourself and on your team at the same time.</p>
<p style="text-align:center; font-family: 'Catamaran',sans-serif;">The rigor of Academic Decathlon will also give you the skills you need to become a successful time manager, test taker, and public speaker. The unique inclusion of Speech, Interview, and Essay rewards the development of well-rounded students who are committed to growing their soft skills in addition to their knowledge. The interdisciplinary nature of the competition will give you the insight to make connections across different areas and critically think about various topics united under one theme. No matter what year you join, you will leave the program having a better understanding of the past and present of the world.</p>
<p style="text-align:center; font-family: 'Catamaran',sans-serif;">Decathlon is one of the most prestigious extracurricular activities in which you can participate, particularly in California. Yes, it will appear fantastic on any college application, especially since you will be joining a team that has a consistent opportunity to perform well and win medals and awards. Orange County is fortunate enough to give scholarships to the top ten students in each GPA category at the regional competition, including a very attractive $1,000 for the top scorer in addition to a host of medals in every event. Many Decathletes also have the opportunity to work a summer job with the Decathlon study resource company DemiDec (whose materials you will use if you join the team) on a relatively flexible schedule.</p>
