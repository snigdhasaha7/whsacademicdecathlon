<td style="vertical-align:top;font-size: 350%; font-family:'Bebas Neue', cursive;">Snigdha Saha</td>
<td rowspan="2" style="font-family:'Catamaran', sans-serif; vertical-align:top">I joined Academic Decathlon as an unconfident sophomore who did not quite have the skills needed to contribute to the success of a team. My work ethic was highly focused on myself and not towards the benefit of an entire group of people. However, becoming a Decathlete truly changed that aspect of me. I am now a confident senior on her way to Caltech, a school that is heavily grounded in collaboration. Luckily, Decathlon taught me to have a team-oriented mindset, a skill I need for success there.<br>
<p style="font-family:'Catamaran', sans-serif">It is true that in Academic Decathlon, every member takes their own tests and participates in their own events, besides Super Quiz. However, all the scores add up to make a team score which places immense responsibility on members to hold up their own weight. I have participated on this team as both a Scholastic (B) and an Honor (A), which is why I can confidently say that regardless of GPA level, every person plays an important role. This mindset allowed for a growth of individual responsibility for the benefit of a team - a trait I would not have acquired in the absence of experience.</p>
<p style="font-family:'Catamaran', sans-serif">Besides that feeling of responsibility, what I also enjoyed about Decathlon was the environment. The people I met in Academic Decathlon were all extremely diverse and unique. Had I not joined the team, I would not have met these amazing individuals, some of whom are now my closest friends. Every year, my team became extremely close, bonding over the long meetings, interesting material and numerous inside jokes. Academic Decathlon gives you a community that is heavily built on the aspect of collaboration, and it is this community that gave me the confidence I lacked prior to my journey as a Decathlete.</p>
<p style="font-family:'Catamaran', sans-serif">As such, I recommend Academic Decathlon to anyone even slightly interested. Of course, if you put your head into it, you will receive medals, recognition and even money. But, if you put your heart into it, you will find a team that supports you no matter what - a team that turns into family.</p></td></tr>
