<td rowspan="2" style="font-family:'Catamaran', sans-serif; vertical-align:top">For most of high school, I unfortunately viewed Academic Decathlon stereotypically as a competition too focused on studying and nothing else. That was until I, just like you right now, decided to discover more about it after our team ran a promotional campaign at the end of my Junior year. As someone who loves both taking tests and interdisciplinary learning, the idea of a competition based around this already was enough to lure me in. However, if I had also known about all of the other benefits it would bring me, I definitely would’ve joined the team as a Freshman rather than as a Senior.<br>
<p style="font-family:'Catamaran', sans-serif">Still, the fact that I had such an enjoyable experience is a testament to the fact that when you start doing Decathlon doesn’t matter; it’s about what you do with it and what you can bring to the team. Starting out was rough because I barely knew anyone on my team, but as we bonded together over studying and socializing, I began to feel like I had met my second family. That was something that I had never found beforehand, and I believe it to be the greatest benefit of the program as a whole.</p>
<p style="font-family:'Catamaran', sans-serif">As someone who is naturally reserved, I can confidently say that Decathlon has propelled me to put my voice out there and be more involved in the things that I love. When the team you work with is simultaneously a group of friends, you start to feel more comfortable in expressing your opinions and emphasizing your input. Crucially, I felt a sense of responsibility to be part of something greater and ventured out of my comfort zone to try to make a difference, and I am very proud of anything that I may have done to help Woodbridge remain the county champion. Thus, I have grown tremendously as a leader through the program while participating in the most gratifying extracurricular activity that I’ve ever taken part in.</p></td></tr>
