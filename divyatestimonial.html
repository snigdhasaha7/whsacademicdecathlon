<td rowspan="2" style="font-family:'Catamaran', sans-serif; vertical-align:top">When I joined Academic Decathlon as a freshman, all I knew was that I would need to read through a binder of material on colonialism, write a speech, and attend a few lunchtime meetings. Looking back, now as a first-year medical student at UCSD and UCLA graduate, I have realized that Decathlon was more than just studying. It allowed me to become an efficient and organized learner, build confidence, and make very close friends.<br>
<p style="font-family:'Catamaran', sans-serif">In college and medical school, we have to understand large amounts of dense material in a short period of time. I wouldn’t be able to efficiently study now if it weren’t for the four years which spent learning how to effectively learn material from a wide range of subject matter. Whether it was making flashcards, building diagrams, or teaching peers, I still use those study strategies today.</p>
<p style="font-family:'Catamaran', sans-serif">Through Decathlon, I also learned how to speak in public and develop my leadership skills. The speech and interview events taught me how to articulate myself appropriately and cater to my audience. As the WHS team captain for three years, I built my confidence and learned how to work with diverse individuals and build team morale. I also experienced many stressful moments and developed the skills to cope with stress and respond positively to negative outcomes and criticism. In college, I used all of these skills while presenting my data at scientific conferences, interviewing for medical school, and leading over 75 members of a volunteering organization.</p>
<p style="font-family:'Catamaran', sans-serif">I met some of my closest friends through Decathlon – people I perhaps wouldn’t have met otherwise. Through our ups and downs as a team, we really got to know each other, shared inside jokes, and made memories we still joke about today. Given how much I value and cherish my Decathlon experience, even five years later, I would highly recommend the program to all students.</p></td></tr>
