<td rowspan="2" style="font-family:'Catamaran', sans-serif; vertical-align:top">For me, Academic Decathlon was one of the definitive experiences of my time in high school. As a side effect of being on the team for so long, my Academic Decathlon experience helped reflect and accentuate the ways I've developed and grown during these years as well as being a key impetus behind some of these changes.<br>
<p style="font-family:'Catamaran', sans-serif">Undoubtedly, one of my most concrete areas of growth was tied to the subjective events in the competition. Entering Academic Decathlon as a freshman, I always considered myself terrible at public speaking— just terrible at talking in general— and I resigned myself to just accept it as something that I couldn't change. I thought I was destined to be the nerdy awkward kid who's best role was to stay quiet and keep my thoughts to myself. Simple class presentations would make my heart race and my voice, and sometimes even my body, shake in nervousness, despite how hard I tried to keep calm. At times, even among a group of well-known friends, I'd be afraid of speaking up out of fear that whatever I had to say would get ignored due to the softness of my voice and low attention-grabbing presence— a wallflower in every sense.</p>
<p style="font-family:'Catamaran', sans-serif">I really only joined Academic Decathlon for the academic portion, which I considered as one of my strengths, and initially dreaded the idea of giving a speech the most. It was a weakness I thought forever would remain a weakness, but as a competitive event I couldn't hide away and leave my weakness as it was without hurting the rest of my efforts and the rest of the team's efforts. The key to public speaking improvement was always said to be practice, practice, practice, and Academic Decathlon— in the best way possible— really forced me to do just that. After hours after hours of practice, I noticed that I became calmer during public speaking simply because I did it so many times before and faced the worst of it already, and overall, I simply was becoming more confident in my speaking skills.</p>
<p style="font-family:'Catamaran', sans-serif">Focusing on concrete aspects like body language, facial expressions, speed, voice inflections, and overall tone helped me improve my speaking little by little. Now, it's by no means perfect but the sense of assuredness I have in speaking is unrivaled. The knowledge that I can be dumped in a random situation and have the ability to speak confidently and coherently is unmatched by any academic information. The ability to convey my thoughts clearly and coherently is frankly very empowering— I know that I can voice my thoughts and opinions in a way that other people can seriously take into consideration and be a vocal representation for whatever I believe strongly in.</p>
<p style="font-family:'Catamaran', sans-serif">You may be thinking, sure public speaking is great and all but what's so special about Academic Decathlon? Well, as the shy, unconfident kid I really avoided any form of public speaking activity thinking that it just wasn't for me. Academic Decathlon is special because it entices people for one aspect of the competition, but really requires each person to improve on their weaknesses. I joined for my strengths in academics but was forced to improve on my weaknesses in speaking— and there are others who have the exact opposite. Regardless of where the weakness lies, Academic Decathlon truly pushed me to confront and work on my weaknesses, incentivizing me through competition to actually work on improvement.</p>
<p style="font-family:'Catamaran', sans-serif">Finally, but most importantly, I was able to gain a greater sense of self-confidence through the many amazing and diverse teammates I've had. They helped create a safe space where I felt that I could truly be myself without hiding those weird idiosyncrasies (hours upon hours together will break down any awkward barriers, trust me). They became close friends that I've laughed with, confided in, and truly enjoyed time with. Each and every one of them made Academic Decathlon a truly unique experience— and Academic Decathlon in its own unique way, helped to connect and facilitate friendships with people I would likely never have met otherwise.</p>
<p style="font-family:'Catamaran', sans-serif">Academic Decathlon truly holds a special place in my heart because it has helped me gain a greater sense of self-confidence through better speaking skills, which enable me to communicate my unique thoughts and ideas with greater assuredness, and through the many close friends I've made, extremely supportive people diversely unique in their own ways that truly show that differences can be strengths and show that my unique oddities and tastes can also be a strength and not a weakness.</p>
<p style="font-family:'Catamaran', sans-serif">If you've read this far, thank you for entertaining a small story about my Academic Decathlon experience, and I hope that you might find an equally amazing one in this one-of-a-kind program :)</p></td></tr>
